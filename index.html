<p><b>My name is Dave Lopez and I’m going to tell you about myself. For starters, I’ve gotten used to coding (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Still Developing)) during my time in college. I really enjoy using Visual Studio Code because its extensions are really useful whenever because they can show me what I need to fix and to make sure that my code functions. I’ve also worked on Adobe Products like Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, InDesign, and XD which have been good so far.</b></p>
